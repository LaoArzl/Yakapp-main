  The Yakan people are among the major indigenous Filipino ethnolinguistic
  groups in the Sulu Archipelago. Also known as dream weaver having a
  significant number of followers of Islam, it is considered one of the 13 Moro
  groups in the Philippines. The Yakans mainly reside in Basilan but are also in
  Zamboanga City. They speak a language known as Bissa Yakan, which has
  characteristics of both Sama-Bajau Sinama and Tausug (Jundam 1983: 7-8). It is
  written in the Malayan Arabic script, with adaptations to sounds not present
  in Arabic (Sherfan 1976). <br /><br />
  The Yakan have a traditional horse culture. They are renowned for their
  weaving traditions.[4] Culturally, they are Sama people who eventually led a
  life on land, mostly in Basilan and Zamboanga city. They are included as part
  of the Sama ethnic group, which includes the Bajau, Dilaut, Kalibugan, and
  other Sama groups.

  The Yakans reside in the Sulu Archipelago, situated to the west of Zamboanga
  in Mindanao. Traditionally they wear colorful, handwoven clothes. The women
  wear tight fitting short blouses and both sexes wear narrowcut pants
  resembling breeches. The women covers it partly with a wrap-around material
  while the man wraps a sash-like cloth around the waist where he places his
  weapon â€“ usually a long knife. Nowadays most Yakans wear western clothes and
  use their traditional clothes only for cultural festivals.

  The Spaniards called the Yakan, "Sameacas" and considered them an aloof and
  sometimes hostile hill people (Wulff 1978:149; Haylaya 1980:13).
  <br /><br />
  In the early 1970s, some of the Yakan settled in Zamboanga City due to
  political unrest that led to armed conflict between militant Moro groups and
  government soldiers. The Yakan Village in Upper Calarian is famous among local
  and foreign tourists because of their art of weaving. Traditionally, they have
  used plants such as pineapple and abaca converted into fibers as basic
  material for weaving. Using herbal extracts from leaves, roots and barks, the
  Yakans dyed the fibers and produced colorful combinations and intricate
  designs.

  intricate design worn by the women around their waist or as a head cloth. The
  Palipattang is patterned after the color of the rainbow while the bunga-sama,
  after the python. Almost every Yakan fabric can be described as unique since
  the finished materials are not exactly identical. Differences may be seen in
  the pattern or in the design or in the distribution of colors.

  Contacts with settlers from Luzon, Visayas, and the American Peace Corps
  brought about changes in the art and style of weaving. Many resorted to using
  chemical dyes, which are more convenient, and started weaving table runners,
  placemats, wall decor, purses, and other items that are not present in a
  traditional Yakan house. In other words, Yakan communities, for economic
  reason, catered to the needs of their customers, demonstrating their trading
  acumen. New designs were introduced, such as kenna-kenna, patterned after a
  fish; dawen-dawen, after the leaf of a vine; pene mata-mata, after the shape
  of an eye or the kabang buddi, a diamond-shaped design.
